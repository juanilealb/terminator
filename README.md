# Terminator for Windows

A Windows desktop app for running multiple AI coding agents in parallel. Each agent gets its own terminal, code editor, and git worktree â€” all in one window.

> **Fork note:** This is a Windows-only port of [@owengretzinger](https://github.com/owengretzinger), originally built for macOS. All macOS code has been stripped for a leaner, Windows-native experience.

## Features

- **Parallel agents** â€” Run separate Claude Code / Codex sessions side-by-side, each in its own isolated workspace
- **Full terminal emulator** â€” `xterm.js` + node-pty with PowerShell/cmd support
- **Monaco code editor** â€” Syntax highlighting, diffs, and file editing
- **Git integration** â€” Staging, committing, branching, and worktree management
- **File tree navigation** â€” Browse project files with git status indicators
- **Cron-based automation** â€” Schedule recurring agent tasks
- **Hook integration** â€” Claude Code and Codex activity/notification hooks (unread indicators, activity spinners)
- **Keyboard-driven** â€” Quick Open, tab switching, and full shortcut support
- **Command palette** â€” Fuzzy command runner plus slash commands
- **Workspace memory** â€” Persistent notes and reusable prompt context per workspace
- **Prompt templates** â€” Mention-aware templates (`@workspace`, `@branch`, `@file:...`, etc.)
- **Snapshots** â€” Workspace checkpoints backed by git stash metadata
- **Local preview** â€” Built-in localhost iframe preview panel

## How It Works

### Workspaces & Worktrees

Each agent workspace is backed by a **git worktree** â€” an isolated checkout of your repo where the agent can make changes without interfering with other agents or your main branch. This means you can:

1. Open a project (any git repo)
2. Create multiple workspaces from it
3. Each workspace gets its own branch, terminal, and file view
4. Agents work in parallel without conflicts

### Agent Integration

Terminator integrates with **Claude Code** and **OpenAI Codex** through:

- **Hook scripts** â€” Node.js scripts that Claude/Codex call to signal activity and completion
- **Unread indicators** â€” Know when an agent finishes or needs attention
- **Activity spinners** â€” See which workspaces have active agent sessions

### Debug Mode

Set `TERMINATOR_DEBUG=1` to enable detailed logging:

```bash
set TERMINATOR_DEBUG=1
bun run dev
```

This logs platform info, PTY lifecycle, hook operations, git status, and path normalization â€” useful for troubleshooting.
